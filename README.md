# QAtest


## To launch the tests on **Windows** use commands "python -m unittest test_mozilla.py" for example


## If you use **Linux** you may have to copy the WebDriver files to the /usr/bin/ and use "python3 -m unittest -v test_mozilla.py" command


## If you will have some troubles with the execution of tests, please, contact me on 'e-mail'
